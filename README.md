## üåü Features

- **Real-time Typhoon Tracking**: Visualizes typhoon paths with smooth animations
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Changes typhoon colors based on intensity categories
- **Landfall Detection**: Automatically detects and marks typhoon landfall points
- **Detailed Information Display**: Shows typhoon names, wind speeds, and pressure data
- **Interactive Timeline**: Includes a time display that matches the simulation accurately
- **UI Elements**: Play / Pause, Skip 1 Week, and Return to Main Menu
- **Data Caching**: Stores previously webscraped data to your computer for faster retrieval

## üõ† Technical Components

### Map Generation (`western_pacific_map_maker.py`)
- Creates high-resolution maps of the Western Pacific region
- Utilizes Cartopy for accurate geographical projections
- Supports both detailed and simplified map versions
- Features include land masses, ocean, country borders, and basic elevation data

### Typhoon Data Scraper (`typhoon_scraper.py`)
- Scrapes typhoon data from Digital Typhoon database
- Extracts detailed track information including:
  - Position (latitude/longitude)
  - Wind speeds
  - Pressure data
  - Timestamps
- Caches data as a '.JSON' to 'root/data' folder

### Visualization Engine (`typhoon_animation.py`)
- Built with Pygame for smooth real-time animations
- Features include:
  - Rotating typhoon symbols
  - Color-coded intensity levels
  - Dynamic fade in/out effects
  - Landfall detection and marking
  - Time scaling for visualization
  - Pause / Play
  - Skip 1 Week

## üé® Visualization Features

### Typhoon Representation
- **Symbol**: Animated rotating spiral with center dot
- **Color Coding**:
  ```python
  category_colors = {
      0: (135, 206, 235),  # Light Blue
      1: (100, 238, 100),  # Light Green
      2: (225, 225, 0),    # Yellow
      3: (255, 130, 0),    # Orange
      4: (255, 0, 0),      # Red
      5: (255, 0, 255)     # Purple
  }
  ```
- **Information Display**: Shows name, wind speed (km/h), and pressure (hPa)

### Animation Effects
- Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
- Constant speed movement between track points
- Rotating blade animation
- Dynamic landfall markers with zoom effects

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- pygame
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- cartopy
- matplotlib
- numpy

### Running the Application
1. Generate the map (first run only):
   ```python
   python scripts/western_pacific_map_maker.py
   ```

2. Start the visualization:
   ```python
   python scripts/stormchaser.py
   ```

### Controls
- Click the "Play" button to start the animation
- Click the "Pause" button to pause the animation
- Click the "Skip 1 Week" button to jump 1 week forward into the timeline
- Click the "Return to Menu" button to regenerate an animation
- Close window to exit

## üìä Data Structure

### Typhoon Object Format
```python
{
    "name": str,            # Typhoon name
    "path": [{
        "time": str,        # Format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
        "lat": float,       # Latitude
        "long": float,      # Longitude
        "class": int,       # Intensity category (0-5)
        "speed": str,       # Wind speed in km/h
        "pressure": int     # Pressure in hPa
    }],
    "start_time": int       # Animation start time offset
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key parameters that can be adjusted:

```python
# Time scaling
TIME_SCALE_FACTOR = 1 / (12 * 60 * 60)  # 1 second = 12 hours

# Screen dimensions
SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT = 1200, 900

# Animation parameters
fade_in_duration = 1
fade_out_duration = 0.5
fps_target = 120
```
